Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains what personal data Mundo.gr collects from you, through our interactions with you and through our products, and how we use that data. Mundo.gr collects anonymous data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our products.


Going forward with the GDPR we aim to fully support the GDPR standard.

We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, 
or protect our rights. We don’t store personal information on our server. 

Our website data is stored in GitHub pages.

We get some of it by recording how you interact with our products by, for example, using technologies like cookies, 
and receiving error reports or usage data from software running on your device.

We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We too don’t like services that ask you for things
like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)

We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, 
or protect our rights.

We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.

In our service, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, 
seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

If you have questions about accessing or correcting your personal data please contact us.


It is Mundo.gr’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.


**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, Mundo.gr collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.


Mundo.gr’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our website.

Website traffic cannot be monitored by GitHub pages engine. We only keep track of anonymous analytics via Google Analytics.


**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Mundo.gr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than any personal information a visitor sends through
our contact form. Visitors that do not want to share their personal information do not have to send us any of their 
contact information through the form. In case a visitor sent us personal information, it is kept for a period of 3 months
in the secure servers of Google Gmail until removed completely.

Our anonymous visitor tracking is handled by Google Analytics (Read Googles Privacy Policy here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.


**Aggregated Statistics**

Mundo.gr may collect statistics about the behaviour of visitors to our website. For instance, we may monitor the most popular
posts on our site or use spam screened by our filters to help identify spam. Mundo.gr may display this information publicly or
provide it to others. However, we do not disclose personally-identifying information.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Mundo.gr does not disclose personally-identifying information of visitors browsing our website.

We disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, 
or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Mundo.gr,
third parties or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via our contact form), we reserve the right to
publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.

Mundo.gr takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration or 
destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public 
authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

Mundo.gr acknowledges that all individuals have the right to access the personal information/data that we maintain about them. 
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should contact us directly
through our contact form. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe, not to exceed one week.

We commit that we will never share any personal data collected through our contact form to any third party.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mundo.gr uses cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of our website, and their website access preferences.
