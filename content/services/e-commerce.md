### Beware of the details that will drive your business to sucess.

##### 1. The correct partner
###### This is your shop. It should not close for a single day.
With the eshop you _engage_ to the partner. You should be careful whom to select for technical support.
##### 2. Your buying audience
###### The eshop must be designed according to its customers
Together we will design and build the best eshop for your needs.
##### 3. The right service
###### Do not leave a single customer disappointed 
With the right tools and constant communication you will be #1 in people's preference

##### 4. We never stop
###### The eshop is a living organism that works non-stop.
When did you close your shop because you got tired of it? The same happens in your e-shop!

There are many ecommerce platforms that help you build an eshop and several of them are sufficient for the daily needs of an eshop. Some of the most well-known platforms are Magento, Prestashop, Opencart, Shopify & Woocommerce/Wordpress.

Some systems are considered top by the global community. That is to say that their core code is so well written that it helps Google read the page faster and pushes it up to higher ranking positions. However, we have witnessed the "best platform" being slow to load and not helping SEO as much as it is advertised globally. This is because the code of the platform is not enough, but the subsystems that the business needs to use for its particular needs, should use clear code too. 

Such subsystems are the template design used, cart functionality and complexity, complexity of categories with filtering and more.  The right partner must be the one who will guide your business in the right choice of an ecommerce platform and its subsystems, based on your needs.
